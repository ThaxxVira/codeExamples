# codeExamples

Motto:  "I may not yet know the answer, but I will find an answer"

The code within this repository are examples for employer review.  Code is added as needed.

For scientific programming and data analysis I have used MATLAB, IDL, Fortran, Python, and Bash scripting.
For Web development I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL (Oracle and MySQL).

I possess a BS in meteorology, a minor in mathematics, and a certificate in Web Development with about 2 - 3 years’ experience in scientific programming and data analysis, 2 years’ experience in mathematics/statistical research, and 3 years’ experience contributing to meteorology and climate projects.

I strive for excellence in all I do and am continually educating myself.  Evidence of these qualities include being the recipient of 12 academic scholarships at the local, state, and national level, admission to 3 honor societies, graduation with high honors, and a few professional recognitions.  I have published professional documentation and presented scientific information to public, administrative, and technical audiences.  I also taught myself most of the mathematics and programming I know from textbooks and websites, and take initiative to learn more, in any subject, as is needed or where my curiosity takes me.  

Admittedly, I do not have the best memory (an effect of a disability I have) when it comes to details of most languages, but within a couple days to a week of review, I am nearly back to where I had left off.  Therefore, I do not prioritize committing things to memory.  Rather, I first focus on the bigger picture of what needs to be done, break apart the problem into manageable chunks, and then find the right tools to complete each task.  If I do not know a particular tool or area of knowledge, I learn it.

I am currently looking for new opportunities related to meteorology, scientific programming, and data analysis, and am open to relocating nationwide.
